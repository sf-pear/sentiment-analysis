# Sentiment Analysis on Twitter data
Project by Sabrina Fonseca Pereira, Ida Maria Zachariassen, Magnus Sverdrup, Rasmus Bondo Hansen and Ruben Oliver Jonsman

This project explores how machine learning models, trained on Twitter data, perform when trying to classify
the writerâ€™s intention. The focus was split into two categories, one predicting irony and the other predicting
stance regarding atheism.

We tested different machine learning models and developed different tokenizers to find
out what combination yielded the best performance when classifying tweets.
